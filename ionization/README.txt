Fitting Aluminium ratio as function of NHI:

log_N(Al++) / N(Al+) = a + b * (log_N(HI) - 20.73)

a = -0.737 ± 0.053
b = -0.784 ± 0.147
scatter = 0.210

The fit is performed without errorbars, as they are all more or less similar
and the fit might otherwise be skewed by the single data point with good uncertainty
on the Al++/Al+ ratio.
The fit is furthermore performed around the mean of the log(NHI) values to minimize
correlations between a and b. This mean value is: 20.73
